          <h3>Character Optimization <small>9/1/2022</small></h3>
          <hr>
          <img class="thumbnail1" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/29/90/40/299040a65de89970ad0d1b98eec092e3.jpg"/>
          <p>In Oblivion, leveling may be one of the most convuleted aspects of the game. While in most RPGs games tend to make a level up worthwhile and neccessary to maintain power, in Oblivion this does not hold true. </p>
          <p>Enemies will continue to scale with your level, and to a degree will never stop scaling, becoming more powerful as you level up. This can cause the player to feel a lack of growth, as the character can never become truly "powerful." However, following this guide as well as some builds, you can effectively break the game and make most combat scenarios a breeze.
          </p>
          
          <h3>MAJOR SKILLS vs MINOR SKILLS</h3>
          <hr>
          <img class = "thumbnail2" src = "https://preview.redd.it/ojo8hjzz93h71.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68c3e1da5846efd5b82f526e04fa683e166cabd8" >/
          <p></p>
          <p>First thing to understand is, that the base skills in Oblivion vary differently in how quickly they level up. This is neccessary to know, since the base classes set by Bethesda in the game will ruin your chances of becoming powerful enough to tackle foes on the highest difficulty </p>
          <p>The reason being, is that major skills determine your level up, while minor skills do not. Every 10 MAJOR skill increases will cause the player to level up. However to efficiently level, the player must level up three different attributes 10 times, using mostly minor skills in order to level properly.</p>
          <p>Raising each attribute using a variety of skills dedicated to that attribute will ultimately allow you to acheive the +5/+5/+1 or +5/+5/+5 attribute increase, when you level up.</p>
          <p>For example, let us assume that you are creating a mage. Generally speaking, a mage will probably focus on the 6 schools of magic. Alteration, Destruction, Conjuration, Restoration, Mysticism and Illusion. However Bethesda, in the base class "Wizard" will make each school of magic a MAJOR skill. This in turn makes it impossible to efficiently level, since each school of magic is dedicated to a different attribute. </p>
          <p>Destruction, for instance is governed by the [ATTRIBUTE] Willpower, while Conjuration is governed by the [ATTRIBUTE] Intelligence. If you tried to raise the intelligence attribute by +5, you would only be able to raise two other attributes by +1.</p>
          <p>So essentially in order to effectively level, you will need to set your major skills, as skills that are either easily controllable, or skills that you will NEVER use unless you wish manually train them via grinding. </p>
          
          <h3> MAJOR SKILL "SET UP EXAMPLE" </h3>
          <hr>
          <img class = "thumbnail3" src = "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/58RbXBGEBSV7gfLxXTK69q_HXblwMdBjC9EZeldVOumORKpkaTpDPB7Y_x4iOf7Cr4txjMFqFWYNA-TwxM8NmdD90dm8CBZ7qDGyX1wBFlWaVnVddTc_gpnkn56RVRMQWAJhk6pn=w600-h315-p-k"
                    width = "750"
                    height = "2000" >
          <p></p>
          <p> For instance, this a mage build that I am currently working on. The major skills that define it are skills that are easily controllable like mercantile, or skills thats I will rarely use like blade/blunt. I will talk more about this build in a later post. </p>
          <p> Finally after taking all of this into consideration, you should make sure you anchor yourself to a level that you are comfortbaly playing at. For example, if you decide to level all the way to 51 (Technical max level in oblivion) it will be extremely difficult to maintain power over enemies that scale with your level. </p>
          <hr>
          <img class = "thumbnail4" src = "https://imgs.search.brave.com/0sdZiOvM8fProXOQgoI6_Suc6K4LcWKu3Gj-ANsl8ho/rs:fit:650:950:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0/aWMud2lraWEubm9j/b29raWUubmV0L2Vs/ZGVyc2Nyb2xsczIv/aW1hZ2VzLzcvNzcv/WGl2aWxhaS5wbmcv/cmV2aXNpb24vbGF0/ZXN0P2NiPTIwMTcw/MjEyMTE0MjQ0JnBh/dGgtcHJlZml4PWRl" > 
          <p></p>
          <p> For example [SMALL SPOILER ALERT] The creature shown above is Xivilai. One of the most powerful creatures in the game, with an absurd magical resistance and heavy physical attack. Xivilai will continue to scale with your level adding more health to their already large health pool, becoming more bulkier in the process. If you are unprepared you will get obliterated. </p>
          <p>[NOTICE] If you are finding the difficulty too hard or unplayable DO NOT hesitate to lower the difficulty. RPGs are meant to tell a story and be an enjoyment, not a chore. Ultimately the game will bend to your own will, you just have to play around with it.</p>

          <p> Mages in Oblivion are absolutely broken if specialized correctly. Even the most toughest enemies can be blasted away with a single weak fireball, if proper spells are applied to the target. </p>
